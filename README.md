# This project used frame differencing and background subtraction for detecting moving objects in videos. Frame differencing subtracts the pixel values of two adjacent frames or frames separated by a certain interval in the video stream. The resulting subtracted image is then thresholded to extract the regions of motion in the image. 
# Background subtraction is a common method for motion segmentation in static scenes. It computes the difference between the current captured frame and the background image to obtain a grayscale image of the moving object regions. These regions are then thresholded to extract the motion areas. To mitigate the influence of varying environmental lighting, the background image is updated based on the currently captured frame.
# This project is based on background subtraction for object detection and utilizes Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for background modeling. It employs Gaussian background subtraction techniques to detect dynamic objects in images and videos. Initially, it trains a background model and then uses it for target detection on individual images. Finally, the same background model is used for target detection on a video or image sequence. This approach enables the code to differentiate between pixels belonging to the static background and those belonging to dynamic foreground objects.
